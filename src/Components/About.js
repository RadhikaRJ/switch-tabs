            <p>Mrs Potter was Mrs Dursley’s sister, but they hadn’t met for several years; in fact, Mrs
Dursley pretended she didn’t have a sister, because her sister
and her good- for-nothing husband were as unDursleyish as it
was possible to be. The Dursleys shuddered to think what the
neighbours would say if the Potters arrived in the street. The
Dursleys knew that the Potters had a small son, too, but they
had never even seen him. This boy was another good reason
for keeping the Potters away; they didn’t want Dudley mixing
with a child like that.
